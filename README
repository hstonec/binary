PARSE

This part of program processes the input from stdin. After the main
program gets the command line, it will call parse_command(3) to
process the command into a structure. This structure contains a string
of the command, a list of options and a list of redirection
information. 

Function parse_command(3) receives one line of command. It will
separate the command into subcommands using "|" and "&". And after
that, the function will store each subcommand into a structure
called "parsed_cmd" (SEE parse.h). This structure contains the
information for one time execution. This function will pull all
structures into a list and set a flag to determine if do background or
not.

When separating subcommands, the program will check if there is a
command following the pipe "|". If there is no command after that, it
will return an error. Because the command is separated by "|" and "&",
if there is no command between "|" and "&", it will return an error
too.
